Release 0.9.8
-------------
* Change scripts to make them work when a space is present in a filename.
* Added Makefile.msvc-win32, a makefile for Microsoft C++ using
Microsoft's "NMAKE" 
* Minor tweak to miinquire.c for Windows builds.

Release 0.9.7
-------------
* Build fixes for Matlab

Release 0.9.6
-------------
 * Added Makefile.macosx
 * Modified bldtobnc.c, delaycorrect.c, intframes.c, micreateimage.c, 
   mireadimages.c, and nframeint.c to support the updated Matlab
   interface.

 * Modified Makefile.linux to force chars to be unsigned in compilation.
   Handles assumptions in micreateimage (and possibly elsewhere).

Release 0.9.5 (25 September, 2001)
-------------
 * Removed memory re-use feature of getimages for matlab 5 and later since
   it causes crashes
 * Fixed handling of float and double files on output, so that valid_range
   gets set properly
 * Modified tempfilename to generate a filename based on time for the
   first call and then add a counter for subsequent calls - this prevents
   conflicts within one matlab run and keeps the likelihood of conflict
   between matlab runs low.
 * Small syntax modifications for compatibility with matlab 5 and 6
 * Added crude hack to delaycorrect.c to only include nan.h under irix
 * Modified openimage to use tempfilename to get name of temp dir
 * Added Makefile.irix6
 * Modified MEX_EXT for linux from mexlx to mexglx

Release 0.9.4 (14 October, 1997)
-------------
 * Added Linux to list of known supported platforms
 * Further bug fixes in openimage and closeimage relating to 
   decompressing files and cleaning them up on close
 * Fixed rcbf2: don't hardcode image size of 16384 (128x128)
 * Rewrote maketac -- much more general and robust now.
 * Fixed to work with MATLAB 5: minor changes to openimage, closeimage,
   newimage, tempfilename, rcbf2.
 * Fixed a bug in gettaggedregion (elimination of non-unique slices bombed)
 * Upped the maximum number of images we can read at a time with 
   mireadimages (to be more fMRI-friendly)
 * Overhauled all the Makefiles, and tweaked things so we can compile
   with MATLAB 4 or 5
 * Added RCS identifiers to every MATLAB and C source file

Release 0.9.3 (22 November, 1995)
-------------
 * Fixed some bugs in openimage/closeimage that arose in handling of
   compressed image volumes.
 * Fixed up loadtagfile: it now handles any valid MNI tag point file
   (previously didn't know about tag labels).  However, loadtagfile
   is still very slow for large (> 500 or so) tag files.  This will
   be corrected in the next release.
 * Fixed getimageinfo so it is case insensitive for *all* options, and
   no longer leaves spurious variables cluttering up the global 
   workspace; also added options MinMax, AllMax, and AllMin, Steps,
   Starts, DirCosines, Permutation.
 * Fixed minor bugs in pixelindex, newimage, and viewimage.
 * Revamped voxeltoworld and worldtovoxel: they now deal with voxel
   coordinates in voxel order (slowest-to-fastest varying dimension),
   and correctly handle all the issues of converting between world 
   coordinates and the various flavours of voxel coordinates.
 * Improved parsing of xfm files in loadxfmfile.
 * Added 'dimnames' and 'permutation' options to miinquire.
 * Added some options to micreateimage (these are not currently
   accessible through the MATLAB interface)

Release 0.9.2 (18 April, 1995)
-------------
 * Greatly enhanced documentation for viewimage.
 * Totally rewrote worldtovoxel, and added getvoxeltoworld and voxeltoworld.
 * Added loadxfmfile, and almost complete rewrite of loadtagfile.
 * Obsoleted calpix in favor of pixelindex, which is actually general
   and useful.
 * Improved handling of system errors (file not found, permission denied,
   disk full -- that sort of thing)
 * Changed openimage/closeimage so that compressed image volumes are
   handled (almost) transparently.

Release 0.9.1 (22 February, 1995)
-------------
 * Revised the Makefiles so that EMMA builds nicely elsewhere
 * Fixed bug in mireadimages, where values outside the valid range
   were not mapped to MATLAB NaN
 * Added some sanity checking to resampleblood routine, to verify
   that the blood activity data (read by getblooddata) is not
   totally bizarre


Release 0.9 (16 November, 1994) 
-----------
 * the first numbered release, although it has been "in beta" for well
   over a year now.

Recent changes with 0.9 include...
 * The rCBF documentation has been thoroughly overhauled, with the 
   "annotated code listings" both greatly expanded and changed
   to reflect the modifications that rCBF underwent in the fall
   of '93 (after the document was first written).
 * Changed rcbf1 and rcbf2 so that they return K1 in 
   mL_blood / (100 g_tissue * min), k2 in 1/min, and V0 in 
   mL_blood / (100 g_tissue)
 * Changed rcbf2 and correctblood so that the user can supply the
   dispersion constant, tau.  If it is not supplied, 4 seconds is
   assumed (previously, 4 seconds was hard-coded into correctblood).
 * Several of the rCBF-related source files (rcbf2, findintconvo, 
   correctblood) were cleaned up and optimised to use the fancy 
   features of rescale and ntrapz.
 * Fixed some minor bugs in miinquire.
 * Changed rescale so that the second argument can be either a scalar
   OR a matrix the same size as the first argument.  Thus, a = a .* b
   can be re-coded more efficiently as rescale (a, b).
