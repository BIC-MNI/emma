Version 0.9 (16 November, 1994) of EMMA is the first numbered
release, although it has been "in beta" for well over a year now.

Recent changes with 0.9 include...

 * The rCBF documentation has been thoroughly overhauled, with the 
   "annotated code listings" both greatly expanded and changed
   to reflect the modifications that rCBF underwent in the fall
   of '93 (after the document was first written).
 * Changed rcbf1 and rcbf2 so that they return K1 in 
   mL_blood / (100 g_tissue * min), k2 in 1/min, and V0 in 
   mL_blood / (100 g_tissue)
 * Changed rcbf2 and correctblood so that the user can supply the
   dispersion constant, tau.  If it is not supplied, 4 seconds is
   assumed (previously, 4 seconds was hard-coded into correctblood).
 * Several of the rCBF-related source files (rcbf2, findintconvo, 
   correctblood) were cleaned up and optimised to use the fancy 
   features of rescale and ntrapz.
 * Fixed some minor bugs in miinquire.
 * Changed rescale so that the second argument can be either a scalar
   OR a matrix the same size as the first argument.  Thus, a = a .* b
   can be re-coded more efficiently as rescale (a, b).

Version 0.9.1 (22 February, 1995)
 * Revised the Makefiles so that EMMA builds nicely elsewhere
 * Fixed bug in mireadimages, where values outside the valid range
   were not mapped to MATLAB NaN
 * Added some sanity checking to resampleblood routine, to verify
   that the blood activity data (read by getblooddata) is not
   totally bizarre

Version 0.9.2 (18 April, 1995)
 * Greatly enhanced documentation for viewimage.
 * Totally rewrote worldtovoxel, and added getvoxeltoworld and voxeltoworld.
 * Added loadxfmfile, and almost complete rewrite of loadtagfile.
 * Obsoleted calpix in favor of pixelindex, which is actually general
   and useful.
 * Improved handling of system errors (file not found, permission denied,
   disk full -- that sort of thing)
 * Changed openimage/closeimage so that compressed image volumes are
   handled (almost) transparently.

Version 0.9.3 (not yet released)
 * Fixed some bugs in openimage/closeimage that arose in handling of
   compressed image volumes.
 * Fixed up loadtagfile: it now handles any valid MNI tag point file
   (previously didn't know about tag labels).  However, loadtagfile
   is still very slow for large (> 500 or so) tag files.  This will
   be corrected in the next release.
 * Fixed getimageinfo so it is case insensitive for *all* options, and
   no longer leaves spurious variables cluttering up the global 
   workspace; also added options MinMax, AllMax, and AllMin, Steps,
   Starts, DirCosines, Permutation.
 * Fixed minor bugs in pixelindex, newimage, and viewimage.
 * Revamped voxeltoworld and worldtovoxel: they now deal with voxel
   coordinates in voxel order (slowest-to-fastest varying dimension),
   and correctly handle all the issues of converting between world 
   coordinates and the various flavours of voxel coordinates.
 * Improved parsing of xfm files in loadxfmfile.
 * Added 'dimnames' and 'permutation' options to miinquire.
 * Added some options to micreateimage (these are not currently
   accessible through the MATLAB interface)
