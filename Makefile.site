# These are directories where the build process looks for various

# the NetCDF and MINC libraries must be in MINCLIB, and the NetCDF
# and MINC header (.h) files must be in MINCINC.

# You shouldn't have to change these unless you have a weird MATLAB

# is where it looks for the MEX library.

#
# These are directories where the various components of EMMA will
# be installed.  All MATLAB files (*.m and CMEX) will be copied
# there, so it is actually better if you have EMMA its own directory,
# such as $(MATLAB_ROOT)/toolbox/emma.  You will then have to add
# this directory to the default MATLAB path by putting the line
#
#  path(path, '/usr/local/matlab/toolbox/emma');
#
# in your matlabrc.m file.  (This file lives in $(MATLAB_ROOT)/toolbox/local.)
#
# The standalone binaries and documentation go, respectively, to
# BIN_INSTALL_DIR and DOC_INSTALL_DIR.

DOC_INSTALL_DIR    = /usr/local/doc

#
# Finally, these are compiler options based on the above directories.
# These almost certainly won't need to be changed, except possibly to
# add /usr/local/include and/or /usr/local/lib if for some reason 
# they aren't automatically searched.  They're just here for
# easy propagation to lower-level makefiles.
