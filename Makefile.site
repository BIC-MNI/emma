# MEX is the script used to compile CMEX programs.  The default,
# bin/cmex under the MATLAB root directory, is for MATLAB 4.  For MATLAB

# there are quite a lot of them, so the default is to give EMMA its own

# directory to the default MATLAB path by putting the line
#
#  path(path, '/usr/local/matlab/toolbox/emma');
#
# in your matlabrc.m file.  (This file lives in $(MATLAB_ROOT)/toolbox/local.)
