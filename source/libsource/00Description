@NAME       : EMMA library
@DESCRIPTION: A library of useful functions that are frequently used
              in EMMA programs.  The functions currently supplied
	      are:
                    ParseArgv  - A function that handles command line
		                 arguments cleanly.
                    intframes  - A function to integrate a function
              		         over a set of frames.
                    lookup     - A function for performing quick table
		                 lookup with linear interpolation.
                    mexutils   - A few little functions that get used
		                 in more than one place for parsing
				 arguments.
                    mincutil   - Set of routines for dealing with MINC
                                 files.  Deals mostly with a structure
                                 (ImageInfoRec) defined in mincutil.h
                                 for telling callers all about a given
                                 MINC file.  GetImageInfo in particular
                                 is very handy.  See mireadimages.c and
                                 miwriteimages.c for examples of these
                                 functions in action.
                    monotonic  - A function that checks to see if a
 		                 data set is monotonic.
                    time_stamp - Function to produce a time stamp
                                 string for a program.  Returns a
                                 string of the form "date > command".
                                 The command is simply the
                                 concatenation of argv elements.
                    trapint    - A function to perform fast
              		         trapezoidal integration of a function.
