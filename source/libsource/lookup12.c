@NAME       : Lookup1
@INPUT      : oldX, oldY - lookup table
              newX - values to look up
              TableRows - number of elements in each of oldX, oldY
              OutputRows - number of elements in newX, newY
@OUTPUT     : newY - interpolated values corresponding to each member of newX
@RETURNS    : (void)
@DESCRIPTION: Perform a linear interpolation on every member of newX
              (ie.  newX[0] .. newX[OutputRows-1]).  Each newX[i] is
              looked up in oldX[] so that the two elements of oldX[]
              bracketing newX[i] are found; newY[i] is then calculated
              by linearly interpolating between the elements of oldY[]
              corresponding to the bracketing elements of oldX[].  

	      If any member of newX[] is NOT within the range of
              oldX[], then the corresponding newY will be set to NaN,
              which must be supplied as a global variable by the
              caller.  (That means that the caller can choose NaN to
              be whatever is desired; to get a "real" NaN for MATLAB,
              mxCallMATLAB (..., "NaN") is a good way.)

              NOTE: It is assumed that OldX is monotonically
              increasing; the behaviour of this function is undefined
              if that is not the case.  It may well loop infinitely or
              generate segmentation faults or other such
              unpleasantries.  Use Monotonic () before calling!!!
