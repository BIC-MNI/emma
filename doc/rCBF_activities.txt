The following must be completed in order to implement a two-compartment
rCBF model in Matlab:

1) Get the most recent articles on performing two-compartment analysis
   that includes solving for V0.

   COMPLETED ON:

   STATUS:


Although the desired final product is a package that solves for K1, K2 and
V0, it is easier to start by neglecting V0.  In order to perform the analysis
while ignoring V0, the following must be completed:

2) Create a Matlab routine that generates the rR lookup table.  This lookup
   table is used to find a value for K2 at each pixel, and should be 100x1
   (100 values of rR corresponding to values of K2 from 0.01 minutes to
   1 minute).

   COMPLETED ON: June 25, 1993

   STATUS: June 25, 1993: Completed.
           June 21, 1993: Created an rR lookup table with Matlab, but not
                          an actual .m file.  However, all of the commands
			  used were saved in a matlab diary.

3) Create a Matlab routine that calculates a value for rL.  Since there is a
   different value of rL for each pixel in the image, rL should be 16384x1 for
   every slice.

   COMPLETED ON: June 21, 1993

   STATUS: Completed.

4) Create a Matlab routine that integrates the above two routines by 
   using the look-up table to find an approximation for K2.  This
   routine can probably also calculate K1 since this is straight
   forward once K2 is known.  This routine should probably just take
   a handle to an input data set, and a handle to an output data set.

   COMPLETED ON:

   STATUS: June 25, 1993: A .m file exists, but it is very rudimentary.
                          Data for a K2 image is generated, but no
                          K1 image is generated.
           June 21, 1993: Played around with getting values for K2 by
                          using the above two functions.  No actual
                          .m file exists yet, but once again all of
  			  the commands used were saved in a matlab
			  diary.

The above three routines will provide an rCBF package that does not take
V0 into account.  At this time, we are not sure of the steps that are
necessary in order to complete an analysis involving V0.  Therefore, these
steps will be included in a later version of this list.
