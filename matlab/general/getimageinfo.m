function info = getimageinfo (handle, whatinfo)
% GETIMAGEINFO   retrieve helpful trivia about an open image
%
%     info = getimageinfo (handle, whatinfo)
% 
% Get some information about an open image.  handle refers to a MINC
% file previously opened with openimage or created with newimage.
% whatinfo is a string that describes what you want to know about.
% The possible values of this string are numerous and ever-expanding.
% 
% The first possibility is the name of one of the standard MINC image
% dimensions: 'time', 'zspace', 'yspace', or 'xspace'.  If these are
% supplied, getimageinfo will return the length of that dimension from
% the MINC file, or 0 if the dimension does not exist.  Note that
% requesting 'time' is equivalent to requesting 'NumFrames'; also,
% the three spatial dimensions also have equivalences that are
% somewhat more complicated.  For the case of transverse images,
% zspace is equivalent to NumSlices, yspace to ImageHeight, and xspace
% to ImageWidth.  See the help for newimage (or the MINC standard
% documentation) for details on the relationship between image
% orientation (transverse, sagittal, or coronal) and the MINC spatial
% image dimensions.
% 
% The other possibilities for whatinfo, and what they cause
% getimageinfo to return, are as follows:
%
%     Filename     - the name of the MINC file (if applicable)
%                    as supplied to openimage or newimage; will be
%                    empty if data set has no associated MINC file.
%
%     NumFrames    - number of frames in the study, 0 if non-dynamic
%                    study (equivalent to 'time')
%
%     NumSlices    - number of slices in the study (0 if no slice
%                    dimension)
%
%     ImageHeight  - the size of the second-fastest varying spatial 
%                    dimension in the MINC file.  For transverse
%                    images, this is just the length of MIyspace.
%                    Also, when an image is displayed with viewimage,
%                    the dimension that is "vertical" on your display
%                    is the image height dimension.  (Assuming
%                    viewimage is working correctly.)
%
%     ImageWidth   - the size of the fastest varying spatial
%                    dimension, which is MIxspace for transverse
%                    images.  When an image is displayed with
%                    viewimage, the image width is the horizontal
%                    dimension on your display.
%
%     ImageSize    - a two-element vector containing ImageHeight and
%                    ImageWidth (in that order).  Useful for viewing 
%                    non-square images, because viewimage needs to know
%                    the image size in that case.
%
%     DimSizes     - a four-element vector containing NumFrames, NumSlices,
%                    ImageHeight, and ImageWidth (in that order)
%
%     FrameLengths - vector with NumFrames elements - duration of
%                    each frame in the study, in seconds.  This is
%                    simply the contents of the MINC variable
%                    'time-width'; if this variable does not exist in
%                    the MINC file, then getimageinfo will return an
%                    empty matrix.
%
%     FrameTimes   - vector with NumFrames elements - start time of
%                    each frame, relative to start of study, in
%                    seconds.  This comes from the MINC variable
%                    'time'; again, if this variable is not found,
%                    then getimageinfo will return an empty matrix.
%
%     MidFrameTimes - time at the middle of each frame (calculated by
%                     FrameTimes + FrameLengths/2) in seconds
%      
% If the requested data item is invalid or the image specified by handle
% is not found (ie. has not been opened), then the returned data will
% be an empty matrix.  (You can test whether this is the case with
% the isempty() function.)
