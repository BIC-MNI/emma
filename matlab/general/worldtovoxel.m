function out = worldtovoxel (volume, in, options)
% WORLDTOVOXEL  convert points from world to voxel coordinates
%
%     v_points = worldtovoxel (volume, w_points [, options])
% or
%     wv_xfm = worldtovoxel (volume)
% 
% If the first form is used, then w_points must be a matrix with N
% columns (for N points) and three rows (for the three spatial
% dimensions).  (Alternately, a four-row form is acceptable: three rows
% for the three spatial dimensions, plus a row of all ones.)
%
% Normally, worldtovoxel assumes that the the voxel coordinates are to
% be used as slice/pixel numbers within EMMA, i.e. that the coordinates
% should be one-based and in the order (slice, row, col).  However, if
% the points are to be used externally (eg., with a C program such as
% mincextract), then they should be zero-based.  Using the 'external'
% option will cause this to be done.  Also, some applications may expect
% voxel coordinates in (x,y,z) order; use the 'world' option when this
% is needed.
% 
% If the second form is used then the just the world-to-voxel transform
% (a 4x4 matrix) is returned.  This is simply the inverse of the matrix
% returned by getvoxeltoworld, modified to convert zero-based to
% one-based and to reorder world-order to voxel-order (unless overridden
% by the 'external' or 'world' options).
% 
% Options are specified as single words, all in the same string.
% Currently the only options are 'world' and 'external'.
% 
% The volume argument must be an image handle as returned by openimage
% or newimage.
% 
% EXAMPLES
% 
% To use the points in a tag file with EMMA:
%
%    h = openimage ('foo.mnc');
%    tags = loadtagfile ('foo.tag');       % get tags in world coordinates
%    vtags = worldtovoxel (h, tags');      % transform to voxel coordinates
%
% vtags will be a matrix with one column per point; the first three rows
% will be slice, row, and column numbers for use with EMMA.  (Slice numbers
% for getimages/putimages, row and column numbers for pixelindex.)
%
% Note that this does NOT give the same vtags as:
% 
%    wv = inv (getworldtovoxel (h));
%    vtags = wv * tags;
% 
% because in this case, none of the conversions from "external"-style voxel
% coordinates to EMMA-style voxel coordinates are done.  It is almost
% always preferable to use worldtovoxel for this type of conversion, as it
% takes care of all the gory details for you.
