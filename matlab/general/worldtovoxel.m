function out = worldtovoxel (volume, in, option)
% WORLDTOVOXEL  convert points from world to voxel coordinates
%
%   v_points = worldtovoxel (volume, w_points [, 'external'])
% or
%   wv_xfm = worldtovoxel (volume)
% 
% If the first form is used, then w_points must be a matrix with N
% columns (for N points) and either 3 or 4 rows.  (If four rows are
% supplied, then the fourth should be all ones; if only three rows are
% supplied, a fourth row of all ones will be added.)  Normally,
% worldtovoxel assumes that the the voxel coordinates are to be used as
% slice/pixel numbers within EMMA, i.e. that the coordinates should be
% 1-based.  However, if the points are to be used externally (eg.,
% written to a tag file), then they should be zero-based.  Adding the
% 'external' flag will cause this to be done.
%  
% If the second form is used then the just the world-to-voxel
% transform (a 4x4 matrix) is returned.  This is simply the inverse of
% the matrix returned by getvoxeltoworld.  Note that that applying
% this transform to points in world coordinates will give zero-based
% voxel coordinates; you must take care of adding 1 yourself if you
% need to use the voxel coordinates within MATLAB.  (See the help
% for getvoxeltoworld for more information.)
% 
% The volume parameter can be either an image handle or a filename.
%
% EXAMPLES
% 
% To use the points in a tag file with EMMA:
%
%    h = openimage ('foo.mnc');
%    w_tags = loadtagfile ('foo.tag');     % get tags in world coordinates
%    v_tags = worldtovoxel (h, w_tags');   % transform to voxel coordinates
%
% Note that this does NOT give the same v_tags as:
% 
%    w2v = inv (getworldtovoxel ('foo.mnc'));
%    w_tags = loadtagfile ('foo.tag');
%    [num_points,n] = size (w_tags);
%    v_tags = w2v * [w_tags' ; ones(1,num_points)];
%
% because in the first case, the coordinates in v_tags will be
% one-based, and in the second case, they will be zero-based.  In
% almost all cases it is preferable to use worldtovoxel and voxeltoworld.
