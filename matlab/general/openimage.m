function ImHandle = openimage (filename, mode)
% OPENIMAGE   setup appropriate variables in MATLAB for reading a MINC file
%
%   handle = openimage (filename)
% 
% Sets up a MINC file and prepares for reading.  This function creates
% all variables required by subsequent get/put functions such as
% getimages and putimages.  It also reads in various data about the
% size and number of images on the file, all of which can be queried
% via getimageinfo.
%  
% If the file in question is compressed (i.e., it ends with `.z',
% `.gz', or `.Z', then openimage will transparently uncompress it to a
% uniquely named temporary directory.  The filename returned by
% getimageinfo (handle, 'filename') in this case will be the name of
% the temporary, uncompressed file.  When the file is closed with
% closeimage, this temporary file (and its directory) will be deleted.
% 
% The value returned by openimage is a handle to be passed to
% getimages, putimages, getimageinfo, etc.
% 
% Note that by default you cannot use putimages to write data into a
% file opened with openimage.  This differs from the behaviour of
% previous versions of EMMA.  However, this can be overridden by
% supplying a `mode' description when you open the file.  In
% particular,
%
%    openimage (filename, 'w')
% 
% emulates the old behaviour of EMMA: you can use the image handle
% returned by openimage here to either read from or write to the file.
% However, use of this feature should be strongly avoided, as it means
% an image volume can be modified with no backup copy and no record of
% the changes made.  When you wish to write data to a MINC volume, you
% should always create a new volume using newimage.

%@NAME       : openimage
%@INPUT      : filename - name of MINC file to open
%@OUTPUT     : 
%@RETURNS    : handle - for use with other image functions (eg. getimages,
%              putimages, getimageinfo, etc.)
%@DESCRIPTION: Prepares for reading/writing a MINC file from within
%              MATLAB by generating a handle and creating a number of
%              fields for use by getimages, putimages, etc.
%@METHOD     : (Note: none of this needs to be known by the end user.  It
%              is only here to document the inner workings of the
%              open/get/put/close image functions.)  
%
%              A handle is created with handlefield to which is associated
%              a number of fields, including Filename, DimSizes, FrameTimes,
%              FrameLengths, and Flags.
%              
%              The functions getimages, putimages, getimageinfo,
%              viewimage, getblooddata, check_sf, and closeimage also
%              use handlefield for retrieving/storing data associated with
%              the file handle.

%@CREATED    : June 1993, Greg Ward & Mark Wolforth
%@MODIFIED   : 93-7-29, Greg Ward: added calls to miinquire, took out
%              mincinfo and length(various variables) to determine
%              image sizes.
%              95-4-12 - 4/20, Greg Ward: changed to handle compressed
%                              files and the new Flags# global variable
%              97-5-27 Mark Wolforth: Minor modification to work with
%                                     Matlab 5, which handles global
%                                     variables differently from Matlab 4.x
