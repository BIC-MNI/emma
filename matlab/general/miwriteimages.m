% MIWRITEIMAGES  write images to a MINC file
%
%   miwriteimages (filename, images, slices, frames)
%
%  writes images (in the format as returned by mireadimages) to a MINC
%  file.  The MINC file must already exist and must have room for the 
%  data.  slices and frames only tell miwriteimages where to put the data
%  in the MINC file, they are not used to select certain columns from images.
%
%  Also, the slices and frames must be valid and consistent with the MINC
%  file, which must exist and have an image variable in it.  The number
%  of images to write (implied by the number of elements in slices or frames)
%  must be the same as the number of columns in the matrix images.  Since
%  miwriteimages only expects to be called by putimages, none of these
%  requirements are checked here -- all that is done by putimages.
%
%  Note that there is also a standalone executable miwriteimages; this 
%  is called by miwriteimages.m via a shell escape.  Neither of these
%  programs are meant for everyday use by the end user.

% make the string simply a '-' to indicate no slices.  (This is only valid
