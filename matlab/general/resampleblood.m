%  reads the blood activity and sample timing data from the study
%  specified by handle, and resamples the activity data at times
%  specified by the string type.  Currently, type can be one of 'even'
%  or 'frame'.  For 'even', a new, evenly-spaced set of times will be
%  generated and used as the resampling times.  For 'frame', the mid
%  frame times will be used.  In either case, the resampled blood
%  activity is returned as new_g, and the times used are returned as
%  new_ts.
%
%  The optional argument samples specifies the number of samples
%  to take.  If it is not supplied, resampleblood will resample the
%  blood data at roughly 0.5 second intervals.
