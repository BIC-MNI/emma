function msg = check_sf (handle, slices, frames)
%  CHECK_SF  determine the validity of slice and frame lists (internal use)
%
%      msg = check_sf (handle, slices, frames)
%
%  examines the lists of slices and frames, compares them to the 
%  properties of the MINC file specified by handle, and generates
%  a reasonably useful error message if there's any inconsistency.
%  check_sf is meant to be called by other EMMA functions, particularly
%  getimages and putimages.
%
%  The specific conditions that cause an error message are:
%
%     - both slices and frames have multiple values
%     - the file has no time dimension, but a frame list was given
%     - the file has a time dimension, but no frame list was given
%     - the file has no slice dimension, but a slice list was given
%     - the file has a slice dimension, but no slice list was given
%     - there were out-of-range frames: frame number either greater than
%       the number of frames or less than one
%     - there were out-of-range slices
%
%  If there are no problems, then the empty matrix is returned.
