function putimages (handle, images, slices, frames)
%PUTIMAGES  Writes whole images to an open MINC file.
%
%      putimages (handle, images [, slices [, frames]])
%
%  writes images (a matrix with each column containing a whole image)
%  to the MINC file specified by handle, at the slices/frames specfied
%  by the slices/frames vectors.
%
%  Note that only one of the vectors slices or frames may have multiple
%  elements; ie., you may not write multiple slices and multiple frames
%  simultaneously.  (This should not be a problem, since you cannot *read*
%  multiple frames and slices simultaneously either.)  If both slices
%  and frames are present in the MINC file, then both slices and frames
%  vectors must be supplied and be non-empty.  If either of those 
%  dimensions are not present, though, then the associated vector must
%  be either omitted or empty.  
%
%  EXAMPLES
%    
%    To write zeros to an entire slice (say, 21 frames of slice 7) of
%    a full dynamic MINC file with 128x128 images [already opened with
%    handle = newimage (...)]:
%
%      images = zeros (16384,21);
%      putimages (handle, images, 7, 1:21);
%
%    To write random data to a single slice (7) of a non-dynamic file 
%    (again 128x128 images):
%
%      image = rand (16384, 1);
%      putimages (handle, image, 7);

%@NAME       : putimages
%@INPUT      : handle - to an already-created image in MATLAB
%              images - matrix of images, where the columns of the matrix
%              contain whole images laid out linearly
%              slices, frames - vectors describing which slices/frames
%              the columns of images correspond to.  Only one of these
%              vectors may have multiple elements, i.e. all the columns
%              of images must correspond to either a certain slice and
%              various frames (listed in the frames vector) or a certain
%              frame and various slices (listed in the slices vector).
%@OUTPUT     : 
%@RETURNS    : (none)
%@DESCRIPTION: Write images to the MINC file associated with handle.  If
%              there is no such MINC file, no action is taken.
%@METHOD     : 
%@GLOBALS    : 
%@CALLS      : miwriteimages (if there is a MINC file)
%@CREATED    : June 1993, Greg Ward & Mark Wolforth
%@MODIFIED   : 93-7-5, Greg Ward: foisted most of the work onto miwriteimages
%              (the .m file, not the CMEX routine).
