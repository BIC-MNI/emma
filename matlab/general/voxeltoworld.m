function [out] = voxeltoworld (volume, in, options)
% VOXELTOWORLD  convert points from world to voxel coordinates
%
%     w_points = voxeltoworld (volume, v_points [, options])
% or
%     vw_xfm = voxeltoworld (volume)
% 
% If the first form is used, then v_points must be a matrix with N
% columns (for N points) and three rows (for the three spatial
% dimensions).  (Alternately, a four-row form is acceptable: three rows
% for the three spatial dimensions, plus a row of all ones.)
% 
% If the second form is used, then just the voxel-to-world transform
% (a 4x4 matrix) is returned.  This is just the transform returned by
% getvoxeltoworld, modified to adjust voxel coordinates from EMMA
% style to some external form, possibly modified by the options
% parameter.
% 
% Normally, voxeltoworld assumes that the the input voxel coordinates
% originate from slice/pixel numbers within EMMA.  (Such coordinates are
% 1-based, in the order (slice,row,column), and possibly "inverted" for
% dimensions with negative step sizes.  See "help getvoxeltoworld" for
% the whole story.)  In this case, part of the voxel-to-world conversion
% involves adjusting the coordinates to a more standard form.  However,
% you can suppress any of these adjustments using the options
% argument.  This argument is just a list of space-separated keywords,
% of which four are possible:
% 
%    xyzorder    assume input voxel coordinates are in (x,y,z) order,
%                i.e. do not permute them from (slice,row,col) order
%    noflip      assume input voxel coordinates refer to unflipped
%                dimensions (any dimensions with negative step sizes
%                will be flipped when read in by EMMA to ensure
%                anatomical consistency)
%    zerobase    assume input voxel coordinates are zero-based
%                (coordinates for use within MATLAB are one-based, and
%                thus must be shifted down before converting to world
%                coordinates
%    external    combines 'noflip' and 'zerobase'
% 
% The `external' option should be used when converting voxel
% coordinates in the standard MINC style used by mincreshape,
% mincextract, etc.  When using voxel coordinates from Display or
% Register (which always use (x,y,z) order), use 'external xyzorder'.
%
% The volume parameter must be an image volume handle as returned by
% openimage or newimage.
%
% EXAMPLES
% 
% To convert an EMMA (slice, row, column)-style coordinate to world
% coordinates (where h is the handle for an open image volume): 
% 
%    w = voxeltoworld (h, [s, r, c]');
%    
% The same, but where [s, r, c] comes from (for example) a C program,
% and are therefore zero-based, non-dimension-flipped coordinates:
% 
%    w = voxeltoworld (h, [s, r, c]', 'external');
% 
% Convert a point (vx,vy,vz) -- voxel coordinates, but in world order --
% to world coordinates (assuming vx,vy,vz are zero-based):
%
%    w = voxeltoworld (h, [vx,vy,vz]', xyzorder external');
