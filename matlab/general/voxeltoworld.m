function [out] = voxeltoworld (volume, in, option)
% VOXELTOWORLD  convert points from world to voxel coordinates
%
%   w_points = voxeltoworld (volume, v_points [, 'external'])
% or
%   wtov_xfm = voxeltoworld (volume)
% 
% If the first form is used, then v_points must be a matrix with N
% columns (for N points) and either 3 or 4 rows.  (If four rows are
% supplied, then the fourth should be all ones; if only three rows are
% supplied, a fourth row of all ones will be added.)  Normally,
% voxeltoworld assumes that the the input voxel coordinates originate
% from slice/pixel numbers within EMMA, i.e. that the coordinates are
% 1-based.  In this case, the coordinates must be made zero-based by
% subtracting one before applying the voxel-to-world transform.
% However, if the points have an origin outside of the EMMA
% environment, they are most likely zero-based.  Adding the 'external'
% flag will cause the subtraction of one to be suppressed.
%  
% If the second form is used then just the voxel-to-world transform (a
% 4x4 matrix) is returned.  This is simply the matrix returned by
% getvoxeltoworld.  Note that to apply this transform to voxel
% coordinates, they must already be zero-based, so you will have to
% subtract one yourself.  (See the help for getvoxeltoworld for more
% information.)
% 
% The volume parameter can be either an image handle or a filename.
