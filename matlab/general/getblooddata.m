function [activity, mid_times] = getblooddata (study)
%  GETBLOODDATA retrieve blood activity and sample times from a study
%
%        [activity, mid_times] = getblooddata (study)
%
%  The study variable can be a handle to an open image, or the name of 
%  a NetCDF (MNC or BNC) file containing the blood activity data for
%  the study.  If it is a handle, getblooddata will first look in the
%  associated MINC file (if any), and then in the associated BNC file
%  (if any) for the blood activity variables.  If just a filename
%  (either a MINC or BNC file) is given, getblooddata will look in that
%  file only.
% 
%  The mid-sample times will be calculated from amongst the variables
%  sample_start, sample_stop, and sample_length.  The default is
%  mid = (sample_start + sample_stop)/2; but if sample_stop is not
%  found in the MNC or BNC file, then mid = sample_start + (sample_length/2)
%  will be used instead.
%
%  If a file that does not exist is specified, or getblooddata cannot
%  find the blood activity data in either the MINC or BNC file, it will
%  print a warning message and return nothing (ie. empty matrices).

%@NAME       : getblooddata
%@INPUT      : study - either a handle to an already opened image, or the
%              name of a NetCDF file (MINC or BNC) containing the blood
%              activity data
%@OUTPUT     : 
%@RETURNS    : the three return variables (all column vectors) simply return
%              the full contents of one of the blood analysis NetCDF
%              variables, namely:
%              activity gets corrected_activity
%              start_times gets sample_start
%              stop_times gets sample_stop
%@DESCRIPTION: Reads blood activity data from either a MINC or BNC file.
%              If the input argument study is an image handle (as returned
%              by openimage), then getblooddata will dig up the filename
%              associated with that handle -- presumably a MINC file -- 
%              and look for the blood activity data there.  (This is done
%              by checking for the existence of the NetCDF variable 
%              blood_analysis, which is the parent of all the variables
%              we're really interested in.)  If the blood data is not found
%              in the MINC file, getblooddata will generate a similiar-
%              looking .bnc filename (eg. foobar.mnc will become foobar.bnc)
%              and then, if it exists, read the blood activity data from
%              there.
%
%              If study is a character string, it is assumed to be the name
%              of a NetCDF file that contains the blood activity data.  
%              getblooddata will attempt to read the data from that file
%              only, and will print a warning and return empty matrices
%              if either the file doesn't exist or doesn't contain the
%              blood analysis data.
