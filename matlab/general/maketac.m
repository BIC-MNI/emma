function tac = maketac (x,y,pet)
% MAKETAC   Generate time activity curves from dynamic PET data

%    tac = maketac (x, y, pet)
% or
%    tac = maketac (offsets, pet)
% 
% 
% Generates a set of time-activity curves (TACs) from dynamic PET data.
% In the first example, a list of x and y voxel coordinates are
% specified by the x and y arguments.  These must be row vectors of the
% same length; if they are 1 x n, then maketac produces n
% TACs.  
% 
% In the second form, you specify a list of offsets into each slice.
% These are just the 1-D analogues of an (x,y) pair, which can be
% computed with the help of pixelindex.  offsets must be a row vector;
% if it is 1 x n, then n TACs will be computed.
% 
% The TACs themselves are computed from a 5x5 square of data around each
% specified point.  In particular, each voxel within that square
% contributes equally to a mean, which is extracted across all frames
% (columns) of the image data.  The size, shape, and weighting (or lack
% thereof) of this kernel are quite hard-coded and unlikely to change.
% 
% EXAMPLES
% 
%    tacs = maketac (1:128, 1:128, pet) 
% 
% gives you 128 TACs, pulled from data along the diagonal of your image
% (points (1,1), (2,2), ..., (128,128)).  If what you really wanted was
% to extract a TAC for every single voxel, you should use the
% offset-based form of calling maketac:
% 
%    tacs = maketac (1:16384, pet)
% 
% which is actually a bit of overkill; you can most likely get away with
% using a mask, as in
% 
%    summed_pet = ntrapz (getimageinfo (h, 'midframetimes'), pet')';
%    mask = summed_pet > mean (summed_pet);
%    tacs = maketac (find (mask)', pet);
