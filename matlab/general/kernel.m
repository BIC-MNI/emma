function krn = kernel (fwhm, style)
% KERNEL   Create a 2D kernel with the specified full-width half-maximum
%
%  kern = kernel (fwhm [, style])
% 
% generates a square matrix containing a 2-D function with the 
% full-width half-maximum FWHM.  Currently the only available
% kernel style is 'gaussian'.  Note that the FWHM is specified
% with respect to matrix coordinates, rather than any physical
% system.  Thus, if you wish to generate a blurring kernel with
% FWHM of (say) 20 mm, you must first find out what physical size
% each pixel in your image corresponds to, and divide the desired
% FWHM by the pixel size to get the FWHM in pixel coordinates.
% 
% For a gaussian kernel, the size of the matrix is such that three
% standard deviations will fit in the kernel on either side of the
% origin (the centre of the matrix).  The kernel matrix will always
% have an odd number of rows/columns so that the Gaussian function
% is centred in the kernel.
%
% The kernel is always normalised such that the total area under 
% it is one.
