%
%  handle  =  handle for the study.  Returned by openimage.
%  slices  =  A vector of slice numbers to analyze
%  ts_Ca   =  The times used for expressing the blood data.  The times
%             should include the end-frame times.  This can be done using
%             the getFDGplasma function.  Units are minutes.
%  Ca      =  The blood data.  Units are nCi/ml.
%  eft     =  The end-frame times.  Units are minutes.
%  c_Time  =  circulation (analysis) time in minutes
%  glucose =  plasma glucose concentration Units are umol/ml.
%  v0      =  assumed value of v0
%  wtf     =  choice of weighting functions in numerical form
%  MMC     =  A vector containing values for the parameters.  This vector
%             should be in the form: [tau phi Kt Vd]
%
%  At the moment, 10 weighting functions are available:
%     w1=1
%     w2=t
%     w3=sqrt(t)
%     w4=t^2
%     w5=dt
%     w6=1/dt
%     w7=exp(-t/a)
%     w8=sin(t/a,c_Time=1)
%     w9=sin(t/a,c_Time=0)
%     w10=cos(t/a,T0=1,c_Time=-1).
%  Actual weighting function is W1=wn11+a1*wn12 and W2=wn21+a2*wn22
%  which make Q2=0 and Q3=0. Give wtf=[n11 n12 n21 n22].
%  So far, the best weighting combination found is wtf = [1 3 1 10];
