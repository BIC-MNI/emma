%
%  The required input parameters are: 
%      A - brain activity, averaged over all gray matter in a slice.  This
%          should be in units of decay / (gram-tissue * sec), and should
%          just be a vector - one value per frame.
%      FrameTimes - the start time of every frame, in seconds
%      FrameLengths - the length of every frame, in seconds
%      g_even - the (uncorrected) arterial input function, resampled at
%               some *evenly spaced* time domain.  Should be in units
%               of decay / (mL-blood * sec)
%      ts_even - the time domain at which g_even is resampled
%
%  The returned variables are:
%      new_ts_even - generally the same as the old time scale,
%                    with some points missing from the end.
%      Ca_even - g_even with dispersion and delay hopefully corrected,
%                in units of decay / (mL-blood * sec).  
%      delay - the delay time (ie. shift) in seconds
%
%  A, FrameTimes, and FrameLengths must all be vectors with the same
%  number of elements (presumably the number of frames in the study).
%  g_even and ts_even must also be vectors with the same number of
%  elements, but their size should be much larger, due to the
%  resampling at half-second intervals performed by resampleblood.
%  
%  correctblood corrects for dispersion in blood activity by
%  calculating g(t) + tau * dg/dt, where tau (the dispersion time
%  constant) is taken to be 4.0 seconds.
%
%  It then attempts to correct for delay by fitting a theoretical blood
%  curve to the observed brain activity A(t).  This curve depends
%  on the parameters alpha, beta, gamma (these correspond to K1, k2,
%  and V0, although for the entire slice rather than pixel-by-pixel) and
%  delta (which is the delay time).  correctblood steps through a series
%  of delta values (currently -5 to +10 sec), and performs a three-
%  parameter fit with respect to alpha, beta, and gamma; the value of
%  delta that results in the best fit is chosen as the delay time.
%
%  options is an entirely optional vector meant for debugging purposes.
%  If options(1) is non-zero, then correctblood will show its progress,
%  by printing out the results of progressive delay-correction fits.  If 
%  it is at least 2, then correctblood will also show progress graphically,
%  by displaying a graph of A(t) and the fits corresponding to every
%  value of delta tried.  If options(2) is zero, then no delay correction
%  will be performed; if options(3) is supplied, then it will be
%  used as delta to do delay correction without the time-consuming
%  fitting.
