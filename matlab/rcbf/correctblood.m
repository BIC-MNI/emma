%
%  The required input parameters are: 
%      A - brain activity, averaged over all gray matter in a slice.  This
%          should be in units of decay / (gram-tissue * sec).
%      startftimes - the start time of every frame, in seconds
%      flengths - the length of every frame, in seconds
%      g_even - the (uncorrected) arterial input function, resampled at
%               some *evenly spaced* time domain.  Should be in units
%               of decay / (mL-blood * sec)
%      ts_even - the time domain at which g_even is resampled
%
%  The returned variables are:
%      Ca_even - g_even with dispersion and delay hopefully corrected,
%                in units of decay / (mL-blood * sec).  Ca_even will
%                be one element smaller than g_even because the last
%                point is lost in differentiating.
%      delay - the delay time (ie. shift) in seconds
%
%  A, startftimes, and flengths must all be vectors with the number
%  of elements (presumably the number of frames in the study).  g_even 
%  and ts_even must also be vectors with the same number of elements,
%  but their size is generally an integer multiple of the number of
%  blood samples taken.  (resampleblood should be used to find g_even
%  and ts_even, and it defaults to doubling the sampling frequency, 
%  so that the number of elements in g_even and ts_even will be twice
%  the number of blood samples taken.
%
%  correctblood attempts to correct for dispersion in blood activity by 
%  calculating g(t) + tau * dg/dt, where tau (the dispersion time
%  constant) is taken to be 4.0 seconds.
%
%  It then attempts to correct for delay by fitting a theoretical blood
%  curve to the observed brain activity A(t).  This curve depends
%  on the parameters alpha, beta, gamma (these correspond to K1, k2,
%  and V0, although for the entire slice rather than pixel-by-pixel) and
%  gamma (which is the delay time).  correctblood steps through a series
%  of delta values (currently -5 to +10 sec), and performs a three-
%  parameter fit with respect to alpha, beta, and gamma; the value of
%  delta that results in the best fit is chosen as the delay time.
%
%  Currently, the delay correction appears to be fairly effective
%  alone.  However, when the dispersion correction is performed, it
%  shifts the blood activity curve quite significantly, and completely
%  screws up delay correction.  (Or so it would seem.)
