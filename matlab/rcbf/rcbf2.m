function [K1,k2,V0] = rcbf2 (filename, slice, progress)
% RCBF2  a two-compartment rCBF model implemented as a MATLAB function.
%
% rcbf2 implements the three-weighted integral method of calculating k2,
% K1, and V0 (in that order) for a particular slice.  It first reads in
% a great mess of data (viz., the brain activity for every frame of the
% slice, frame start times and lengths, blood sample activity, and blood
% sample times).  Then, a simple mask is created and used to filter out
% roughly all points outside the head.
%
% The actual calculations follow the procedure outlined in Ohta et. al.
% (see the references section in the document "RCBF Analysis Using
% Matlab").  Thus, all equation numbers cited in this M-file refer to
% that paper.
%
% Starting with Eq. 23, we calculate the ratio on the left-hand side,
% rL, for every pixel.  Then, we generate lookup table for the
% right-hand ratio, rL, for a series of k2 values.  The calculated rL
% values are used to lookup in this table (since rL == rR) to find k2
% for every pixel.  Then, Eq. 24 is used to calculate K1.  This 
% requires calculating the moderately complicated int_activity (left
% hand side of Eq. 24) and the extremely complicated k2_conv_ints
% (right hand side).  However, the expression for k2_conv_ints
% appeared already in the numerator of rR, so we preserve that lookup
% table as conv_int1 and use it to lookup k2_conv_ints.  These
% two long vectors (with one number for every pixel) are then
% divided to get K1.  Finally, V0 is calculated via Eq. 26.

end

% Input arguments are checked, so now we can do some REAL work, ie.
% read in all the data we need.  FrameTimes, FrameLengths, and 
% midftimes should be self-explanatory.  Ca_even is the blood
% activity resampled at some evenly-spaced time domain; ts_even
% is the actual points of that domain.  Ca_mft is the blood activity
% resampled at mid-frame times (needed for integrating).

FrameLengths = getimageinfo (img, 'FrameLengths');

[Ca_even, ts_even] = resampleblood (img, 'even');

% Notice!  We are here employing what is (I think) an incorrect
% method of finding Ca_mft [blood activity, resampled at mid-frame
% times], namely to resample the evenly resampled blood activity.
% It would be better to call resampleblood (img, 'frame'), but
% that makes things blow up.  (Singularity in rR lookup table.)

%[Ca_mft] = resampleblood (img, 'frame');
Ca_mft = lookup (ts_even, Ca_even, midftimes);

% Generate a simple mask: all pixels in integrated image > average

PET = getimages (img, slice, 1:length(FrameTimes));
PETsummed = PET * FrameLengths;
mask = PETsummed > mean(PETsummed);

% Now apply the mask to the images in PET (this may be a little slow,
% but it's better memory-wise than creating 21 copies of mask 
% and .* with PET).

for i=1:size(PET,2)
   PET(:,i) = PET(:,i) .* mask;

% Initialise the weighting functions w3 and w2;

w3 = sqrt (midftimes);
w2 = midftimes;

% Pick values of k2 and then calculate rR for every one.  (Ie. create
% the lookup table).  This is done by first calculating various
% weighted integrals (conv_int{1,2,3} and Ca_int{1,2,3}) which are
% in turn used to calculate lots of other RCBF parameters.  Here 
% we use them specifically to find rR.  NB. conv_int{1,2,3} are tables,
% with one value for every k2 in k2_lookup.  However, Ca_int{1,2,3} are
% simply scalars.

if (progress); disp ('Generating k2/rR lookup table'); end
k2_lookup = (-50:0.02:50) / 60;
[conv_int1,conv_int2,conv_int3] = findintconvo (Ca_even,ts_even,k2_lookup,...
      midftimes, FrameLengths, [], w2, w3);

Ca_int1 = Ca_mft' * FrameLengths;
Ca_int2 = (w2 .* Ca_mft)' * FrameLengths;
Ca_int3 = (w3 .* Ca_mft)' * FrameLengths;

rR = ((Ca_int3 * conv_int1) - (Ca_int1 * conv_int3)) ./ ...
     ((Ca_int3 * conv_int2) - (Ca_int2 * conv_int3));

% Now, we must have the k2/rR lookup table in order by rR; however, 
% we also want to keep k2_lookup in the original order.  This
% is because the first lookup uses rL as a lookup into rR to
% find k2 (which requires that rR be monotonic, ie. sorted) whereas
% subsequent lookups all use k2 to find conv_int{1,2,3} -- which 
% requires that k2_lookup be monotonic.  So k2_lookup will be the
% list of k2's in order, and k2_sorted will be the same list, but 
% in order according to the sorted rR.

[rR,sort_order] = sort (rR);
k2_sorted = k2_lookup (sort_order);

% for that term.  Also, the first term of the numerator -- M(t) 
% integrated across frames -- was calculated above for masking
% the slice.  The denominator is just Ca(t) integrated across
% frames, so we need to use the resampled Ca(t) -- Ca_mft --
% for the integral.

% Magic number time: convert the values to the correct units.
% k2 is currently expressed in units of s^-1 but should be expressed
% min^-1; K1 is in (nCi * sec * (g blood)) / ((mL tissue) * counts * sec)
% and should be (mL blood) / ((g tissue) * minute).  Since blood and
% tissue are both taken to be 1.05 g / mL, and 1 nCi = 37 count/sec, and
% of course 1 min = 60 sec, the conversion factor is 2013.605442176871
% NOT SURE ABOUT UNITS OF V0 RIGHT NOW!!!!!

k2 = k2 * 60;
K1 = K1 * 2013.605442176871;
