function [K1,k2,V0,delta] = rcbf2 (filename, slice, progress, correction)

% RCBF2 a two-compartment (triple-weighted integral) rCBF model.
%
%       [K1,k2,V0,delta] = rcbf2 (filename, slice)
% 
% rcbf2 implements the three-weighted integral method of calculating
% k2, K1, and V0 (in that order) for a particular slice.  This
% function also returns the delay value calculated for blood
% correction.  It first reads in a great mess of data (viz., the brain
% activity for every frame of the slice, frame start times and
% lengths, plasma activity, and blood sample times).  Then, a simple
% mask is created and used to filter out roughly all points outside
% the head.
% 
% The actual calculations follow the procedure outlined in the
% document "RCBF Analysis Using Matlab".  Occasionally, comments in
% the source code or documentation for various functions involved in
% the analysis will refer to equations in this document.  The most
% relevant functions in this respect are rcbf2 itself, correctblood
% and findintconvos.
% 
% The starting point of the three-weighted integration method is Eq.
% 10 of the RCBF document.  The left hand side of this equation, rL,
% is calculated for every pixel.  Then, a lookup table relating a
% series of k2 values to the rR (the right-hand side of Eq. 10) is
% calculated.  This lookup table should have a few hundred elements,
% as calculating rR is considerably more expensive than calculating
% rL.  Since rL and rR are equal, we use the pixel-wise values of rL
% to lookup k2 for every pixel.
% 
% Then, Eq. XXX is used to calculate K1.  This requires calculating
% the moderately complicated int_activity (left hand side of Eq. XXX)
% and the extremely complicated k2_conv_ints (right hand side).
% However, the expression for k2_conv_ints appeared already in the
% numerator of rR, so we preserve that lookup table as conv_int1 and
% use it to lookup k2_conv_ints.  These two long vectors (with one
% number for every pixel) are then divided to get K1.  Finally, V0 is
% calculated via Eq. YYY.

% Pick values of k2 and then calculate rR for every one.  (Ie. create

% Now, we must have the k2/rR lookup table in order by rR; however,

% is because the first lookup uses rL as a lookup into rR to
% find k2 (which requires that rR be monotonic, ie. sorted) whereas
% subsequent lookups all use k2 to find conv_int{1,2,3} -- which 
% requires that k2_lookup be monotonic.  So k2_lookup will be the

% in order according to the sorted rR.
