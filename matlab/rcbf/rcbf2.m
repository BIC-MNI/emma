% RCBF2 a two-compartment (triple-weighted integral) rCBF model.
%
%       [K1,k2,V0,delta] = rcbf2 (filename, slices ...
%                  [, progress [, correction [, batch [, tau]]]]] )
% 
% rcbf2 implements the three-weighted integral method of calculating
% k2, K1, and V0 (in that order) for a particular slice.  This
% function also returns the delay value calculated for blood
% correction.  It first reads in the brain activity for every frame of
% the slice, frame start times and lengths, plasma activity, and blood
% sample times.  Then, a simple mask is created and used to filter out
% roughly all points outside the head.
% 
% The optional arguments progress, correction, and batch control
% whether to print periodic progress reports, perform delay/dispersion
% correction, and automatically select the grey-matter mask used for
% delay/dispersion correction.  These all default to 1 (true); the
% latter two should only be set to 0 (false) in exceptional
% circumstances (i.e. never).  tau is also an optional argument
% that sets the dispersion constant; if it is not given, 4 seconds
% is assumed.
% 
% The actual calculations follow the procedure outlined in the
% document "RCBF Analysis Using MATLAB" (http://www.mni.mcgill/system/
% mni/matlab/rcbf/rcbf.html) .  Occasionally, comments in the source
% code or documentation for various functions involved in the analysis
% will refer to equations in this document.  The most relevant
% functions in this respect are rcbf2 itself, correctblood and
% findintconvos.
% 
% The starting point of the three-weighted integration method is Eq.
% 10 of the RCBF document.  The left hand side of this equation, rL,
% is calculated for every pixel.  Then, a lookup table relating a
% series of k2 values to rR (the right-hand side of Eq. 10) is
% calculated.  This lookup table should have a few hundred elements,
% as calculating rR is considerably more expensive than calculating
% rL.  Since rL and rR are equal, we use the pixel-wise values of rL
% to lookup (linearly interpolate) k2 for every pixel.
% 
% Then, the numerator of Eq. 10 is used to calculate K1.  This
% requires independently calculating the numerators of the left and
% right hand sides of the equation for every voxel, and taking their
% ratio to determine the exact value of K1 at that voxel.  However,
% since the right-hand-side is very expensive to compute, we make use
% of the fact that most of the information has already been calculated
% -- in particular, for the k2-rR lookup table.  This is then used to
% lookup values of the integrals needed, which are then combined to
% calculate the entire right hand side of Eq. 10.
% 
% Note: it is assumed that input PET data is in units of nCi/mL_tissue
% (= 37 Bq/mL_tissue = 37 Bq / 1.05 g_tissue).  This is converted to
% Bq/g_tissue for all internal calculations.  Blood data is input in
% Bq/g_blood; this is calibrated to the PET scanner (using the
% cross-calibration factor) and converted back to Bq/g_blood.  Thus,
% K1 is calculated internally as g_blood / (g_tissue * sec).  The
% final step of the rCBF analysis is to convert this to the more
% standard mL_blood / (100 g_tissue * min).  k2 and V0 are similarly 
% converted to 1/min and mL_blood / (100 g_tissue).
