% RCBF2  a two-compartment (triple-weighted integral) rCBF model.
%
%                [K1,k2,V0] = rcbf2 (filename, slice)
%
% rcbf2 implements the three-weighted integral method of calculating k2,
% K1, and V0 (in that order) for a particular slice.  It first reads in
% a great mess of data (viz., the brain activity for every frame of the
% slice, frame start times and lengths, blood sample activity, and blood
% sample times).  Then, a simple mask is created and used to filter out
% roughly all points outside the head.
%
% The actual calculations follow the procedure outlined in Ohta et. al.
% (see the references section in the document "RCBF Analysis Using
% Matlab").  Thus, all equation numbers cited in this M-file refer to
% that paper.
%
% Starting with Eq. 23, we calculate the ratio on the left-hand side,
% rL, for every pixel.  Then, we generate lookup table for the
% right-hand ratio, rL, for a series of k2 values.  The calculated rL
% values are used to lookup in this table (since rL == rR) to find k2
% for every pixel.  Then, Eq. 24 is used to calculate K1.  This 
% requires calculating the moderately complicated int_activity (left
% hand side of Eq. 24) and the extremely complicated k2_conv_ints
% (right hand side).  However, the expression for k2_conv_ints
% appeared already in the numerator of rR, so we preserve that lookup
% table as conv_int1 and use it to lookup k2_conv_ints.  These
% two long vectors (with one number for every pixel) are then
% divided to get K1.  Finally, V0 is calculated via Eq. 26.

% Now, we must have the k2/rR lookup table in order by rR; however, 
% we also want to keep k2_lookup in the original order.  This
% is because the first lookup uses rL as a lookup into rR to
% find k2 (which requires that rR be monotonic, ie. sorted) whereas
% subsequent lookups all use k2 to find conv_int{1,2,3} -- which 
% requires that k2_lookup be monotonic.  So k2_lookup will be the
% list of k2's in order, and k2_sorted will be the same list, but 
% in order according to the sorted rR.
