% given a table of k2 values, generates tables of weighted integrals
% that commonly occur in RCBF analysis.  Namely, int_convo is a table of
% the same size as k2_lookup containing
%
%       int ( conv (Ca(t), exp(-k2*t)) * weight )
%
% where the integration is carried out across frames.  weight is
% one of w1, w2, or w3, each of which will generally be some simple
% function of midftimes.  findintconvo will return int2 if and only if
% w2 is supplied, and int3 if and only if w3 is supplied.  w1 is 
% required, and int1 will always be returned.  Normally, the weight
% functions should be vectors with the same number of elements as
% midftimes; however, if w1 is empty then the weighting function 
% is taken to be unity.
%
% Note that in order to correctly calculate the convolution, Ca(t) must
% be resampled at evenly spaced time intervals, and this resampled blood
% activity should be passed as Ca_even.  The times at which it is
% sampled should be passed as ts_even.  (These can be calculated by
% resampleblood before calling findconvints.)
%
% Then, the convolution of Ca(t) and exp(-k2*t) is resampled at the
% mid-frame times (passed as midftimes) and integrated across frames
% using flengths as dt.

% exp (-k2 * t)] where (*) represents convolution.  (The t here is
% ts_even.)  integrand is then integrated across all frames
% by a simple rectangular integration, just as the image data is
% integrated in findrl.m.  This is then repeated for every element in
% the k2 vector to create a table of possible k2's and the two
% integrated convolutions conv_int1 and conv_int2 as described above.
