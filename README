Welcome to EMMA!
================

EMMA stands for Extensible Matlab Medical Analysis.  It is a MATLAB
package developed at the Montreal Neurological Institute McConnell
Brain Imaging Centre, and was created to allow non-programmers to
develop medical analysis applications quickly and interactively.
Previously this development was done on a VAX in FORTRAN.  Obviously,
the execution time of software developed under an interactive
environment such as MATLAB cannot compete with the execution time of
compiled code.  However, the reduced complexity of development, and
consequently reduced development time is a significant advantage.

How to Install EMMA
-------------------

EMMA consists of:

     a) MATLAB scripts.  These do not need to be compiled.
     b) CMEX programs.  These are dynamically loaded by MATLAB when
        they are called, and must be compiled.  You will need the cmex
	script supplied with MATLAB, as well as the MINC and NetCDF
	libraries.  You should have obtained these along with EMMA;
	if not, they are available by anonymous ftp from 
	yorick.mni.mcgill.ca:/pub/minc.
     c) Stand-alone C programs.  These require both the MINC and
        netCDF libraries.
     d) LaTeX documentation.  Figures are included using the widely
        available psfig package.


To build EMMA (after unpacking the archive):

     1) Edit the top level Makefile to reflect the directory where
	EMMA was unpacked.  (This is NOT necessarily the directory
	to which EMMA will be installed.)
     2) Edit Makefile.site for various site-dependent parameters.
	These include the architecture type, the directories where
	MATLAB, MINC, and NetCDF are installed, and the directories
	to which EMMA will be installed.  Be sure to read the comments	
	in Makefile.site carefully.
     3) Type "make"


To install EMMA:

     1) Type "make install".  (Note that you must have already edited
	Makefile.site to set the destination directories.)  All MATLAB
	files (.m and CMEX) will be copied to a specified directory,
	and the standalone binaries will be copied to a different
	directory.

Assuming that MATLAB is installed under /usr/local/matlab (this can be
changed in Makefile.site), then EMMA will by default be installed to
/usr/local/matlab/toolbox/local.  Since there are a large number of
MATLAB files in EMMA, however, we recommend that you create a separate
directory for EMMA, and modify the MATLAB path to search there.  For
instance, you could change MATLAB_INSTALL_DIR in Makefile.site to
/usr/local/matlab/toolbox/emma.  You would then have to change the
MATLAB path to also search for files in this directory; this can be
done for an individual user by setting the MATLABPATH environment
variable, i.e. add

     setenv MATLABPATH /usr/local/matlab/toolbox/emma

to your .cshrc file.  To make a system-wide modification, add
the line

     path(path, '/usr/local/matlab/toolbox/emma');

to your matlabrc.m file.  (This file lives in toolbox/local under the 
root MATLAB directory.)

The binary executables should be somewhere in your default search
path.  Therefore, they could go in /local/bin, /usr/bin,
/usr/local/bin or wherever else is convenient.  Alternatively, you
could create a separate directory for these files as well, and add
this directory to your path variable.

The documentation files can go wherever you normally put documentation
files.  We provide our original LaTeX source files, our DVI files, and
compressed PostScript(tm) output files.  Between all these options,
you should have some way of printing out the final documentation.  We
are currently working on an interactive HTML (Hyper Text Markup
Language) version of the documentation suitable for browsing with a
World Wide Web (WWW) client such as NCSA Mosaic (available from
ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu, and well worth looking at).  You can view this
documentation via http://www.mni.mcgill.ca/system/mni/emma/emma.html.


Bug Reports
-----------

At this time, EMMA is still an experimental system under development.
However, since this software is actually used for medical research, we
make every effort to ensure that the code is bug free.  We welcome bug
reports, or suggestions for further improvements.
